<h1 class='header'>The dubious honour of hosting the Olympic Games</h1>

<div id='container'>
    <p class='intro'>

    <span class='first-letter'>I’</span>ve never won a gift. The first gift I ever had I had to buy. It was an old bicycle with a chain that broke everyday, and I had to fix it. And today, people we don’t even know have given me the greatest gift a president could wish for: To host the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.” It was with tears in his eyes that Brazilian president Lula da Silva accepted the decision of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to send the Olympic Games to South America for the first time in history. He added that the city deserved the honour of hosting because it had “suffered” in the past. “This victory is a restitution for a people who often appear only in a negative light in the press,” he said. “Those who think Brazil can’t afford to host the Games will be surprised.”

    </p>

    <p>

    Seven years later, with Lula’s presidency just a fond memory to most Brazilians, the circus has left town. In many ways the <em>cariocas</em>, the people of Rio, have indeed surprised Western observers and defied expectations, if only because their consensus seemed to be that a catastrophic failure of some kind was not out of the question. Not a single case of Zika was reported among athletes or visitors during the Games, the organisers delivered an impressive opening ceremony on a minimal budget and, in a last-minute surge, managed to sell a remarkable number of Paralympics tickets. Whether having an ailing region like Rio run a multi-billion dollar entertainment event during what turned out to be the middle of a national financial crisis was a smart investment into the future is an entirely different question however.

    <p>

    Hosting the Olympic Games is expensive. How much exactly it costs is difficult to tell because it requires investing in general infrastructural projects that might or might not be realised without the Olympics, or turn out very differently otherwise. <a href='https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2804554'>A recent University of Oxford study</a> helps determine a lower boundary for the total bill, however, as it looks at just the sports-related costs of the last 25 events. If host cities didn’t spend this money – on construction expenses for sports venues and the Olympic village, plus the operational cost of staging the Games – they wouldn’t be able to hold any competitions or the opening and closing ceremonies. Since the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, these figures have amounted to at least two billion dollars for every Olympics, but more recently crawled up to between two and ten times that amount.

    </p>
    <p>

    What kind of return do you get on such an investment? Robert A. Baade, professor for economics at Lake Forest College in Illinois, has studied the economics of sporting mega-events for more than a decade. In his newest paper <a href='https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.30.2.201'>‘Going for the Gold: The Economics of the Olympics’</a>, co-authored with fellow researcher Victor A. Matheson, he gives an overview of the cost and benefits of hosting the Games. His conclusion is that staging the Olympics typically represents a financial sinkhole and leads to economic net benefits “only under very specific and unusual circumstances.”

    </p>
    <p>

    To find out whether this verdict is accurate, let’s take a look at the revenue side of the Games. As a media mega-spectacle, the Olympics generate considerable proceeds from broadcast rights, sponsoring deals and ticket sales, of course. However, these earnings usually add up to only a fraction of what the event costs. The impressive sum of 3.3 billion dollars reported by the organising committee for the 2012 Games in London, for example, represented less than a quarter of the sports-related cost alone. Thus, throughout history, politicians eager to host have had to come up with other justifications for the spending spree inevitably associated with the event. They have alleged that the Olympics pay for themselves and far beyond their cost, presumably, in two steps: First through a windfall of cash pumped into the local economy via the construction and hospitality sectors, then through a long lasting ‘legacy’ effect built on improved general infrastructure and the city’s newly revitalised global perception.

    </p>
    <p>
     
    When touting the supposed benefits of the Olympics in the former category, proponents of the event typically point to one of a few historic cases that seem to support their case. Their poster child in this regard has been Barcelona, home to the 1992 Summer Games, which nearly doubled visitor numbers within a decade after the Olympics and has steadily grown as a tourism destination ever since, a success story unparalleled in Europe. While academics acknowledge this achievement, they have argued that certain qualities of the city – such as its geographic situation – combined with historical neglect on the part of the Spanish government created a rather unique environment for such a transformation to happen.

    </p>
    <p>

    Olympic hosts are also infamous for producing pre-event reports that vastly overestimate economic gains from the spectacle. The State of Utah, for instance, claimed that the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City would generate about 35000 years worth of jobs in the area. <a href='https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/jbnst.2012.232.issue-3/jbnst-2012-0309/jbnst-2012-0309.xml'>An independent scientific study conducted after the event</a>, however, suggests a figure of only 4000 to 7000 jobs created, concentrating mostly in the year of the event.

    </div>

    <p>The impact of the Salt Lake City Games, which are sometimes mentioned as another rare positive example of hosting in scientific literature, is further called into question by comparing the growth of travel-related expenditures in Utah to that in neighbouring states. While it must be noted that figures in the entire region lie above the national average, neither did revenues spike during the the year of the Games nor did the supposed legacy of the event help Utah mitigate the economic decline caused by the global financial crisis of 2008.

    </p>
    <p>
    Unfortunately, historic disappointments haven’t kept more recent hosts from making bold promises. Ahead of the 2012 Games, then-mayor of London Boris Johnson said the city was looking forward to welcoming <a href='http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-18687800'>“one million extra visitors a day”</a> (compared to what baseline, no one knows) and had Transport for London record a personal message of his to be played on the tube, warning commuters of crowded carriages. In reality, London saw fewer international visitors during the summer of 2012 than in the corresponding quarters the years before and after – an effect that is not uncommon at mega-events like the Olympics.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, if you’re interested in the absolute worst case of what can happen if you rapidly inflate the hospitality sector of a previously inconspicuous town to accommodate tens of thousands of guests just for a 16-day event, you might want to take a look at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, where <a href='http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3152/147154699781767738'>a study claims 40 percent of full-service hotels went bankrupt</a> within just five years after the Games.

    </p>
    <p>
    But perhaps hosting the Olympics is about something bigger than hotel beds and subway rides. It’s a testament to both a people’s collective capability and its leaders’ genius, a surefire way to gain a reputation on the world stage. What if, in the long run, it is this grandstanding rather than pleasing tourists that makes for Olympic returns?

    <p>

    At first glance, the bigger picture does indeed look very different. <a href='https://www.nber.org/papers/w14854'>A 2009 study</a> found that countries staging the Games observe an increase in exports, an effect that is “statistically robust, permanent and large.” However, the researchers went on to note that “unsuccessful bids to host the Olympics have a similar positive impact on exports.” The reason for this phenomenon, they concluded, must be that the act of bidding sends a positive signal to potential business partners around the world – an important first step in opening up an economy.

    </p>
    <p>

    Baade believes this interpretation confuses cause and effect. “There are lots of other things going on in these countries that explain why it is that at the time they bid for the Olympic Games they might experience an increase in economic activity”, he says. What he is implying is that neither hosting nor bidding to host the Olympics necessarily facilitates growth – countries are simply more likely to join the competition if they’re already expecting a bright future.

    </p>
    <p>

    Ultimately, Professor Baade says he’s not surprised that expanding roadways, building light rail, improving communications or building an airport would lead to an economic boost. The important point is that the most fruitful investments seem to be those that a government could make without having to go through the hassle of hosting the Games. “Wouldn’t it be better for a country if it could avoid especially the ruinous expenditures on sports infrastructure,” he asks, “and just develop a plan that would include the kind of infrastructure improvements that we do associate with improved long-term growth?”

    </p>

    <h2>Why do cities keep bidding for the Olympics?</h2>

    <p>
    If economic benefits from the Games have historically been underwhelming at best, why do cities and entire nations keep getting excited about the opportunity to organise them? There’s a number of possible explanations to this conundrum, some more mundane than others. For one thing, politicians are just humans: They can be swayed by many things, from a personal desire to set themselves a monument of some kind to a wad of cash passed to them by one of the powerful players in those businesses that do profit from the Games.
    </p>
    <p>

    But Professor Baade also offers a different explanation from the field of auction theory, dubbed the ‘winner’s curse’. The premise is this: If multiple parties bid on an asset of unknown value – like drilling rights in uncharted oil fields – the buyer will be whoever overestimated the value of the asset the most.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, it is important to point out that bidders’ economic and political profiles have become much more varied over the course of the last three decades, so perhaps the assumption that cities or nations ‘keep bidding’ is flawed to begin with.

    <p>

    Comparing bidding countries by their Human Development Index  – an admittedly rough indicator of a nations’s economic and social maturity – one can see that the wealthy nations of the global north have recently started to see competition from numerous developing economies, starting around the time the 2000 Olympics were up for the taking (the Games are usually awarded seven years in advance). Interestingly enough, the IOC has not displayed any special reservations against these types of bids, selecting, for instance, Beijing, Sochi and Rio de Janeiro over candidate cities from sometimes significantly higher ranked nations.

    </p>
    <p>

    Secondly, in 2012, the Italian government did what no competing nation had done for two decades – it cancelled Rome’s bid for the 2020 Summer Games. Then-prime minister Mario Monti, an economist by profession, said it would be irresponsible for the country to pursue such a project, considering the poor state of the national economy at the time. Three years later, the IOC was publicly humiliated when the European cities of Oslo, Stockholm, Lviv and Krakow <em>all</em> withdrew their bids for the 2022 Games, citing a lack of support from the public, politics or both. With Oslo having already been selected as one of three candidate cities, the committee was left to decide between Almaty, Kazakhstan, and Beijing, China, metropoles representing the pride of authoritarian regimes infamous for trampling on human rights.

    </p>
    <p>

    Finally, two more cities – Hamburg and Boston – have already dropped out of the race for the 2024 Games, which are only going to be awarded next year. This outcome was particularly remarkable in Hamburg, where 52% of voters rejected the proposal in a 2015 referendum, as all local political parties but the Left had supported an application. Opposition to the bid was organised in a grassroots campaign, ‘NOlympia Hamburg’, which was frequently stymied by local authorities “not acting neutral at all,” according to its media spokesman Florian Kasiske.

    </p>
    <p>

    Kasiske believes the public is growing more skeptical about the Games by the day because the IOC is failing to present itself as a reliable partner. Host city contracts such as the one Hamburg would have had to sign, he says, are “an unbelievable impudence, leaving all rights to the committee and handing the city all responsibilities.” Reform plans for the application procedure presented two years ago, dubbed ‘Olympic Agenda 2020’, have been welcomed by experts – Baade says they “provide at least some semblance of solutions” – but have yet to take effect for a full bidding cycle. For the moment, the committee seems to be bothered neither by <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/oct/04/tokyo-olympics-soaring-costs-set-up-showdown-ioc'>reports of skyrocketing costs at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo</a> nor by human rights and environmental concerns in Beijing, which is planning to host part of the 2022 Winter Games on <a href='http://www.businessinsider.com/beijing-olympic-mountain-venue-has-barely-any-snow-2015-7'>what is essentially a snowless mountain</a>.

    </p>
    <p>

    Whether it is economic experts, activists or Olympic fans I talk to, all point me to the same reason for the Games’ recent popularity issues. No one opposes the idea of a global sporting event that highlights the remarkable performances of athletes from nations and disciplines that are otherwise invisible in the mass media. However, the Olympic bidding process simply doesn’t encourage the achievement of such a spectacle with minimum financial, social and environmental cost. The IOC has shown an inclination towards megalomania rather than sustainability, host cities on the other hand have been dishonest about the true cost of these shindigs, promoting the bizarre idea that billions of spending on sports stadiums were a mandatory requirement for urban development in wholly unrelated areas.

    </p>
    <p>

    If the sustainability enigma of the Olympics has not been solved, it’s not been for a lack of ideas. The Games could cycle between a handful of hosts, economists have suggested, or be held in the same city twice in a row. But even if the basic system is left unchanged, the cost-benefit proposition of the event could be completely overturned if the IOC finally did what it’s promised to do long ago: Award the Games to those cities that appear best prepared to minimise the hangover that inevitably comes with hosting a party of Olympic dimensions. Similarly, politicians will have to ask themselves whether winning a bid serves more than just their personal aspirations or the plans of a small business elite. Until that happens, it seems likely that more and more societies will pass on the honour of hosting the Olympic Games.
